# Homebase Flights

> Flight deal alerts from your home airport. Not JFK. Not LAX. Your actual home airport.

## What is Homebase Flights?

Homebase Flights is an airport-specific flight deal alert service. Unlike generic deal sites where 70-80% of alerts are from airports you can't use, 100% of Homebase Flights alerts depart from your chosen home airport.

## Key Information

- **Price:** $59/year after 7-day free trial
- **Average savings:** $500+ per trip
- **Deal frequency:** 2-3 highly relevant deals per week (not 20-30 irrelevant ones)
- **Guarantee:** 3× savings guarantee—save at least $177 or get a full refund
- **Founded:** 2025

## The Problem We Solve

Most flight deal services prioritize major hubs (JFK, LAX, LHR). If you live in Denver, Atlanta, Seattle, or any non-hub city, 70-80% of alerts are useless. You see "Amazing deal to Barcelona!" and get excited, then notice it's from New York—not your city. That $320 "deal" becomes $650+ once you add positioning flights.

Homebase Flights eliminates this. Every alert departs from your airport.

## How It Works

1. Select your home airport (we cover 16+ major airports worldwide)
2. We monitor thousands of routes 24/7 for price drops, mistake fares, and flash sales
3. When we find a deal from YOUR airport, we send it to you
4. You book directly with the airline—keep all the savings and miles
