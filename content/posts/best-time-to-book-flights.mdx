faqs:
  - question: "Is Tuesday really the cheapest day to book flights?"
    answer: "This is a popular myth. Research shows there's no consistently cheapest day to book. Airlines adjust prices based on demand in real-time, not on a weekly schedule."
  - question: "Should I wait for prices to drop?"
    answer: "Generally, no. Flight prices are unpredictable. If you find a fare that's significantly below average for your route, book it. Waiting often means paying more."
  - question: "Do prices drop closer to the departure date?"
    answer: "Usually the opposite—prices tend to increase as the departure date approaches. Last-minute deals are rare for leisure travel."

When should you book your flights? It's one of the most common questions travelers ask. Here's what the data tells us.

## Domestic Flights

For flights within your country, the sweet spot is typically 1-3 months before departure. Booking too early or too late usually means higher prices.

Airlines release seats in fare buckets. The cheapest buckets sell out first, so booking early gives you access to better prices—but not too early, or you'll miss sales and promotions.

## International Flights

For international travel, aim to book 2-8 months in advance. Peak season flights (summer, holidays) should be booked earlier, while off-season travel allows for more flexibility.

Long-haul flights have more price volatility, so setting up price alerts is especially valuable for international routes.

## Day of the Week

Contrary to popular belief, there's no consistently "cheapest day" to book. Prices fluctuate based on demand, not the calendar.

What matters more is the day you fly. Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays are often cheaper to fly than Mondays, Fridays, and Sundays.

## The Real Secret

The best time to book is when you find a great deal. Prices are unpredictable, so when you see a fare significantly below average, book it.

This is why deal alert services are so valuable. Instead of constantly checking prices, you get notified when exceptional deals appear—often lasting only hours before they're gone.

## Holiday Travel

For major holidays (Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc.), book as early as possible—ideally 3-4 months ahead. These are peak demand periods with limited seat availability.

Consider alternative dates too. Flying on Christmas Day itself, for example, is often cheaper than December 23rd.
