## The Key to Budget Travel

The destination is just part of the equation. Finding a cheap flight is often the biggest savings opportunity.

A $600 flight to Portugal becomes a $300 flight when you catch a deal. That extra $300 pays for a week of meals.

This is why flight deal alerts are so valuable—they turn expensive destinations into affordable ones.
