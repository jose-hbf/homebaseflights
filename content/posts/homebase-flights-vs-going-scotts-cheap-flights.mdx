faqs:
  - question: "Is Going (Scott's Cheap Flights) worth it in 2026?"
    answer: "Going delivers genuine value for the right traveler: someone US-based, flexible on dates and destinations, and booking at least 1-2 international trips annually. Premium at $49/year makes sense for economy-focused travelers, while Elite at $199/year appeals to those chasing business class deals and comprehensive mistake fare coverage."
  - question: "Can I use both services at the same time?"
    answer: "Many travelers do exactly this: keeping Going for broad US-based deal coverage and Homebase Flights for targeted deals from their one main airport. Using both increases email volume but maximizes your chance of spotting the best possible price. Both offer free trials (14 days for Going Premium, 7 days for Homebase Flights)."
  - question: "Do flight deal alert services actually save money?"
    answer: "Yes, but with important caveats. Services like Going and Homebase don't create discounted fares—they surface them quickly so you can book before prices rebound or seats sell out. For travelers booking at least one or two flights per year, even a single well-timed deal easily pays for an annual subscription multiple times over."
  - question: "What are mistake fares and which service finds more of them?"
    answer: "Mistake fares (also called error fares) are rare airline or OTA pricing errors that can drop prices by hundreds of dollars. Going surfaces mistake fares differently by tier: Premium focuses on home airport mistake fares, while Elite includes all monitored airports. Homebase Flights includes mistake fares when they originate from your chosen home airport. Neither service can guarantee a steady stream—these are opportunistic by nature."

If you're searching for a Scott's Cheap Flights alternative, you've likely noticed the landscape of flight deal alert services has evolved significantly. Going (the rebranded Scott's Cheap Flights) remains a dominant player, but newer services like Homebase Flights have emerged with a different philosophy.

This comparison breaks down exactly how these two cheap flight newsletters differ, what each costs, and which one will actually help you book flights and save money based on how you travel.

## TL;DR — The Quick Comparison

Here's the quick answer for readers searching "homebase flights vs going" or "best flight deal service 2026": Going sends more total deals from multiple US airports, while Homebase Flights sends only deals from your one home airport.

Going works best for extremely flexible travelers who can use several airports. Homebase Flights works best for people who almost always fly from one airport and don't want to filter through irrelevant deals.

| Feature              | Going                                | Homebase Flights                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Price                | Free / $49 / $199 per year           | $59/year (one plan)                   |
| Airports monitored   | Up to 5-10 (you choose)              | 1 (your home airport)                 |
| Deal types           | Economy, Business, First             | Economy                               |
| Mistake fares        | Premium+ (home airport), Elite (all) | Included                              |
| Departure countries  | US only                              | US, UK, Europe, Asia, Australia       |
| Founded              | 2013                                 | 2025                                  |
| Free trial           | 14 days                              | 7 days                                |
| Money-back guarantee | No                                   | Yes (3x savings or refund)            |
| Flexibility required | High (dates + destination)           | Medium (dates vary, destination open) |

**The single biggest difference:**

* Going monitors 5-10 airports you select, sending more total flight deals but including many from airports you may never actually use

* Homebase Flights monitors only your one departure airport, sending fewer emails but ensuring every deal is directly bookable without a positioning flight

## What Is Going (Formerly Scott's Cheap Flights)?

Going, formerly known as Scott's Cheap Flights, rebranded in 2023 after a decade as one of the most recognized names in the flight deal space. The service started in 2013 when founder Scott Keyes discovered a $480 round-trip mistake fare from New York to Europe that should have cost over $2,000—and began sharing similar finds with friends.

Today, Going operates as a subscription-based cheap flight newsletter with over 2 million members. When reading any Going formerly Scott's Cheap Flights review, you'll notice the service focuses exclusively on flights departing from US airports. The platform specializes in economy deals on the Premium tier, with business class deals and first class deals reserved for Elite subscribers.

The entire model is built around flexibility. Going works best when members remain open to multiple destinations and variable travel dates. If you have a fixed itinerary—say, you need to fly to Miami on specific dates for a wedding—a cheap flight newsletter like Going won't help much. But if you're simply hunting for the cheapest international flights available and can adjust your plans, the value proposition becomes clearer.

### How Going Works

When you sign up for Going, you select your preferred departure airports—up to 5 on the free Limited plan and up to 10 on Premium or Elite. The service then monitors fares from these airports to over 900 destinations worldwide.

Here's the process of going formerly Scott's Cheap Flights how it works deal alerts: Flight Experts (humans supported by algorithms) scan fares continuously, applying what they call the "Bestie Test"—only sharing deals they'd personally send to close friends. When they spot a significant price drop, mistake fare, or exceptional discount, they send email alerts with direct links to book via airlines or online travel agents.

Going doesn't sell tickets directly. They point you to airlines or booking sites where you complete the purchase. This means you need to act quickly—the best deals and error fares can disappear within hours as airlines correct pricing errors or seats sell out.

Key constraints to understand: Going covers US departure airports only, which excludes travelers based in London, Frankfurt, Sydney, or other international hubs. The multi-airport approach also means you'll receive deals from cities you may not live near. A subscriber in Philadelphia tracking PHL, JFK, EWR, and BOS will see deals from all four airports, even though some require 2+ hour drives or positioning flights to access.

For verification and specific trip planning, Going recommends using Google Flights alongside their alerts.

### Going's Pricing Plans

Going offers three tiers with distinctly different value propositions:

**Limited (Free):**

* Continental US deals only

* Up to 5 departure airports

* Delayed notifications (deals may be gone before you see them)

* No business or first class deals

* Limited mistake fare coverage

**Premium ($49/year):**

* All economy deals, domestic and international

* Mistake fares from your designated home airport

* Weekend getaway alerts

* Up to 10 departure airports

* 14-day free trial

**Elite ($199/year):**

* Everything in Premium

* Premium economy, business class, and first class deals

* All mistake fares from all monitored airports

* Points and miles deals

There's no money-back guarantee—it's an annual subscription where perceived value depends on booking frequency and flexibility. Is Going premium worth it? For many travelers, the $49 Premium tier hits the sweet spot. Elite at $199 makes sense primarily for frequent travelers actively chasing business class deals or those who treat mistake fares as a hobby.

Some users on Reddit have reported "fewer wow deals" since the 2023 rebrand, though Going still surfaces substantial discounts compared to typical prices. Are flight deal newsletters worth it at these price points? If you book even one international flight per year using an alert, the subscription typically pays for itself.

## What Is Homebase Flights?

Homebase Flights launched in 2025 as a focused flight deal alert service built around one simple idea: most travelers depart from the same airport 90% of the time. Instead of monitoring multiple airports and flooding your inbox with deals from cities you'll never use, Homebase tracks only your one chosen home airport.

This positioning makes it a natural Going alternative for travelers tired of seeing cheap flights from airports 300 miles away. If you've ever deleted a deal email because it departed from an airport you'd never realistically use, you understand [why home airport deals matter](/blog/flight-deals-from-your-home-airport).

Unlike Going's US-only coverage, Homebase Flights works for major hub airports across the US, UK, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Whether you need [cheap flights from JFK](/cheap-flights-from-new-york), [London flight deals](/cheap-flights-from-london) from Heathrow, or departures from Singapore Changi, Homebase covers it—with expansion to additional airports ongoing.

The core differentiators: single-tier pricing at $59/year, a 7-day free trial, a money-back guarantee (triple your subscription in savings opportunities or get a refund), and zero noise from irrelevant airports.

### How Homebase Flights Works

Setup takes about two minutes. You choose exactly one home airport—JFK, LAX, LHR, CDG, SIN, or whichever hub you actually fly from. Homebase then monitors fares departing from that single airport and sends alerts when deals surface.

Alerts focus on economy deals (including basic economy with clear notes on restrictions like no checked bags or seat selection), notable mistake fares and error fares, and significant price drops from your home airport to popular and surprise destinations. You might receive a deal for Lisbon one week and Tokyo the next—the common thread is that every deal departs from your airport.

There's no need to manage multiple airports or constantly tweak settings. The aim is a low-noise inbox with a few high-quality deals per week that you can actually book without extra logistics. This flight deal alert service works well alongside Google Flights price alerts for specific trips you're planning—Homebase catches the opportunistic deals while Google Flights handles targeted monitoring.

In any flight deal alerts comparison, the differentiator becomes clear: more services prioritize volume, while Homebase prioritizes relevance. Every email should contain deals from your airport, not someone else's.

### Homebase Flights Pricing

Homebase Flights keeps pricing simple: one plan at $59/year with a 7-day free trial. No Premium vs Elite confusion, no feature gating.

The money-back guarantee works like this: if you don't receive at least 3x your subscription price in realistic, bookable savings opportunities within the year (compared to typical historical prices), you can request a refund. This removes the risk of paying for a service that doesn't deliver.

Compare this to Going's three-tier structure where you might wonder whether Going premium worth it over Limited, or whether Elite justifies 4x the Premium price. Homebase's approach appeals to non-obsessive travelers who want a "set and forget" membership without analyzing feature matrices.

**Quick recap:**

* $59/year, single tier

* 7-day free trial

* Money-back guarantee (3x savings or refund)

* No upsell to business class tier (yet)

* Annual subscription, cancellable before renewal

## The Core Difference: Multiple Airports vs Your One Airport

Almost every "Going vs Scott's Cheap Flights alternative" debate comes down to one central design choice: monitor many departure airports (Going) or only your main departure airport (Homebase Flights).

This isn't a minor feature difference—it fundamentally shapes what lands in your inbox and whether you'll actually book flights from those alerts.

More airports means more total deals but more noise. You'll see amazing $400 round-trips to Paris, but they might depart from an airport requiring a 4-hour drive or a separate positioning flight. One airport means fewer emails but higher personal relevance—every deal is from where you actually live and fly.

Consider two travelers: someone based in Denver with one usable airport (DEN) versus someone in the NYC metro area who can realistically use JFK, EWR, LGA, and even BOS or PHL. Their optimal flight deal alert service looks completely different.

![A map view showing flight routes from a single airport hub, illustrating the concept of focused departure point versus multiple airport options.](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1524661135-423995f22d0b?w=800&h=500&fit=crop)

### Going's Multi-Airport Approach

Going allows users to track 5 departure airports on the free Limited plan and up to 10 airports on Premium/Elite—all within the US.

The upside is dramatically more deal volume. By monitoring major hubs like JFK, LAX, ORD, and ATL plus regional airports, you increase your chances of catching rare mistake fares and deep discounts. Going's 900+ destinations become accessible from whichever of your tracked airports offers the best price.

The downside is inbox noise. Many subscribers receive exciting deals from airports 200-500 miles away that require extra positioning flights or long drives. A New York-based traveler tracking JFK, EWR, BOS, and PHL might see 10-15 deals per week, but only half depart from airports they'd realistically use. The Boston departures sound great until you factor in the 4-hour drive or separate flight.

This multi-airport model works brilliantly for travelers who:

* Live between several usable airports (LA metro, Bay Area, Chicago area)

* Are extremely flexible on departure logistics

* Already treat positioning flights as normal travel behavior

Going's approach pairs well with flexible dates searches on Google Flights Explore—if you're wide open on both destination and departure airport, you maximize your chances of catching something exceptional.

### Homebase Flights' Single-Airport Focus

Homebase tracks exactly one chosen airport, filtering out everything else by design. When an email arrives, you know it departs from your home airport—no scanning for fine print, no calculating drive times, no positioning flight math.

This approach benefits specific travelers:

* **Families** who aren't driving 3 hours to save $100 per ticket when traveling with kids

* **Travelers in smaller cities** with one realistic airport option (Phoenix, Denver, Atlanta residents who use PHX, DEN, or ATL exclusively)

* **People overwhelmed by deal newsletter volume** who want fewer but more actionable emails

The trade-off is fewer total emails compared to Going's multi-airport firehose. But a higher percentage of those deals become booked flights rather than deleted emails.

Unlike Going's US-only departure coverage, Homebase Flights serves both US and non-US airports. A London resident can receive LHR-specific deals, something Going doesn't offer at all. Same for travelers based in Frankfurt, Paris, Singapore, or Sydney.

For readers researching "homebase flights vs going" in 2026, this international coverage represents a significant differentiator—Going simply isn't an option for non-US travelers, while Homebase was built with global departures in mind.

### Which Approach Saves You More?

Savings potential differs based on travel style rather than service quality.

Going's volume and multiple airports increase the probability of spotting massive headline savings—$300 business class tickets to Europe, $200 mistake fares to Asia. But these savings only materialize if you can actually use the departing airport and adjust your travel plans accordingly.

Homebase's focus means repeat, realistic savings from flights you'll actually take. Fewer total deals, but a higher conversion rate from "interesting email" to "booked ticket."

Are flight deal newsletters worth it from either service? The math usually works if you book at least one or two flights per year via the alerts. A single well-timed deal easily exceeds the $49-$59 annual cost.

Booking window and flexibility heavily influence outcomes. Going tends to shine when you can travel off-peak and book within ideal windows—[1-3 months out for domestic, 2-8 months for international flights](/blog/best-time-to-book-flights). Homebase shines when you want opportunistic deals from one local airport throughout the year without extra legwork.

**Rule of thumb:**

* Frequent solo traveler with flexible dates and destinations -> Going Premium or Elite likely delivers more value

* Occasional family traveler flying 1-2 times annually from a single airport -> Homebase Flights subscription likely delivers more realistic value

* Non-US traveler -> Homebase Flights is your only option between these two

For readers searching "flight deal alerts comparison" or "scotts cheap flights vs" alternatives, here's the detailed breakdown:

| Feature                   | Going Premium ($49) | Going Elite ($199) | Homebase Flights ($59) |
|---------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------:|
| Economy deals             | ✅                   | ✅                  | ✅                      |
| Business/First class      | ❌                   | ✅                  | ❌                      |

**Mistake fares handling:** This matters for travelers chasing the flight deal mistake fares opportunities. Going Premium includes mistake fares only from your designated home airport, while Elite expands to all monitored airports. Homebase includes mistake fares from your single home airport—fewer total opportunities, but every one is usable.

**Departure country coverage:** Going serves US departures exclusively. Homebase covers US, UK, European, Asian, and Australian hub airports. For non-US travelers, this single factor makes the decision automatic.

**Airport selection model:** Going's multi-airport approach maximizes deal volume at the cost of relevance. Homebase's single-airport model sacrifices volume for direct applicability. Neither is objectively better—they serve different use cases.

## Where Going Wins

Going (formerly Scott's Cheap Flights) is a proven, excellent cheap flight newsletter with clear strengths that any honest Going.com review 2026 should acknowledge:

* **Larger route and destination coverage** — 900+ destinations versus Homebase's smaller but growing network

* **More total deals** — Multi-airport monitoring means significantly higher deal volume

* **Business and first class deals** — Elite tier offers premium cabin opportunities unavailable elsewhere

* **Points and miles deals** — Elite members receive alerts for award travel opportunities

* **Mobile app** — Instant push notifications for time-sensitive deals

* **Established track record** — Operating since 2013 with 2M+ members and proven deal-finding methodology

These advantages matter most to:

**Digital nomads and frequent flyers** who treat travel as lifestyle rather than occasional vacation. More destinations, more deal types, and business class options create genuine value for people booking 5-10+ flights annually.

**Extremely flexible travelers** who can adjust both destination and dates based on price. If you simply want to go somewhere interesting and cheap, Going's volume approach delivers more options.

**Points and miles enthusiasts** based in the US who want both cash fare deals and award travel opportunities from one service.

Is Going premium worth it for these users? Generally yes—the $49 investment pays off quickly for anyone booking at least one deal-driven international flight annually.

## Where Homebase Flights Wins

Homebase Flights isn't trying to outdo Going on number of deals. Instead, it wins on relevance and usability for travelers who value signal over noise.

* **Every deal is from your single home airport** — No filtering required, no positioning flights needed

* **Works for both US and non-US departures** — London, Frankfurt, Singapore, Sydney, and other international hubs covered

* **Less inbox noise** — Fewer emails, but every one matters

* **Simple pricing** — $59/year, one tier, no feature matrix to analyze

* **Money-back guarantee** — 3x savings or refund removes subscription risk

* **Built for 2025-2026 travel patterns** — Designed around the reality that most travelers use one airport

This model particularly benefits:

**Families and couples** who need predictable departure logistics. When you're traveling with kids, you're not driving 3 hours to catch a deal from a faraway airport.

**Overwhelmed newsletter subscribers** who deleted their last cheap flight newsletter because the volume-to-relevance ratio made the emails worthless.

**Travelers outside the US** who cannot use Going at all. A Scott's Cheap Flights alternative for London or Sydney residents simply doesn't exist in Going's model.

**Honest trade-offs:** Homebase offers fewer total destinations than Going's 900+, no business/first class tier yet, and no mobile app yet. For travelers prioritizing volume and premium cabins, these matter.

## Who Should Choose Going?

Going makes sense for travelers who match this profile:

* **Based in the US** with realistic access to multiple airports (NYC metro, LA metro, Chicago area, Bay Area)

* **Extremely flexible** on both destination and travel dates—happy to go wherever the deals lead

* **Frequent flyers** booking 3+ trips annually who can capitalize on high deal volume

* **Chasing business class** and first class deals (Elite tier)

* **Points and miles enthusiasts** who value airline miles deal alerts

* **Prefer mobile apps** for instant push notifications on time-sensitive deals

Going's free Limited plan works as a low-risk way to test flight deal alerts before upgrading. You'll see fewer deals with delayed notifications, but enough to evaluate whether the format works for you.

Is Going (Scott's Cheap Flights) worth it in 2026? For flexible, deal-driven travelers booking at least one or two significant trips per year via the service, the answer is generally yes. The savings potential easily exceeds the $49 Premium subscription. Elite at $199 requires more trips or a focus on premium cabins to justify.

Those who don't match this profile—especially people who only use one airport or need non-US departures—will likely find Homebase Flights a better fit.

## Who Should Choose Homebase Flights?

Homebase Flights makes sense for travelers who match this profile:

* **Almost always depart from one airport** and don't want to calculate positioning flights

* **Families and casual travelers** booking 1-3 trips per year who want occasional standout deals from their local airport

* **Non-US travelers** in the UK, Europe, Asia-Pacific, or Australia looking for London flight deals, European hub deals, or other non-US departures

* **Overwhelmed by high-volume newsletters** and wanting fewer but more relevant emails

* **Price-sensitive subscribers** who appreciate the money-back guarantee and simple $59/year pricing

Is a cheap flight newsletter worth it for this audience? Value comes from bookable deals rather than sheer volume. If you book one international flight per year using a Homebase alert and save $200+, you've earned 3-4x your subscription back.

Some advanced travelers choose to use both services—Going for broad US coverage and Homebase for targeted home-airport deals. But for those picking one service based on home-airport relevance, Homebase is purpose-built for that use case.

## The Bottom Line

Going (formerly Scott's Cheap Flights) remains the best-known US-focused cheap flight newsletter with multi-airport monitoring, 900+ destinations, and business/first class options on Elite. It's a proven service with 2M+ members and a decade of deal-finding credibility.

Homebase Flights is the focused Scott's Cheap Flights alternative designed to send only deals from your one home airport. Simple $59/year pricing, non-US departure coverage, and a money-back guarantee make it a lower-risk choice for travelers who value relevance over volume.

Neither model is universally "better." Each serves different travel styles:

* **Choose Going** if you're extremely flexible, use multiple US airports, want business class deals, or prioritize maximum deal volume

* **Choose Homebase Flights** if you fly from one airport, want fewer but more relevant emails, need non-US departures, or prefer guaranteed value

Before committing, reflect on how you actually travel. How flexible are your dates and destinations? Do you realistically use multiple airports or just one? Test both services during their free trials to see which aligns with your real booking patterns.

For specific trip planning, combine these newsletters with [Google Flights tips](/blog/google-flights-tips) and understand the [best time to book](/blog/best-time-to-book-flights) for your routes.

If you're tired of deleting deals from airports you'll never use, [Homebase Flights](/) offers a purpose-built alternative for 2026 and beyond—built around how most travelers actually fly.
