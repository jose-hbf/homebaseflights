faqs:
  - question: "Is Google Flights the cheapest way to book?"
    answer: "Google Flights is excellent for searching, but not always the cheapest for booking. It's a metasearch engine that shows prices from various sources—always compare before booking."
  - question: "Does Google Flights show all airlines?"
    answer: "Most, but not all. Some budget carriers like Southwest don't appear on Google Flights. Check airline websites directly for complete options."
  - question: "Can I book directly on Google Flights?"
    answer: "Sometimes. Google Flights often redirects you to the airline or a booking site. When 'Book on Google' is available, you can complete the purchase without leaving."
  - question: "How accurate are Google Flights prices?"
    answer: "Generally very accurate, but prices can change between searching and booking. The price is only guaranteed once you complete the purchase."

Google Flights is one of the most powerful flight search tools available—and it's completely free. Here's how to use it like a pro.

## The Explore Feature

Click "Explore" on the Google Flights homepage to see a map of destinations with prices. This is perfect when you're flexible about where to go.

You can filter by:
- Budget (e.g., under $300)
- Trip duration
- Interests (beaches, skiing, etc.)
- Time of year

Let the deals guide your destination choice.

## Date Flexibility Tools

Use the "Date grid" and "Price graph" views to find the cheapest days to fly. These visualizations show you at a glance when prices are lowest.

The price graph is especially useful—it shows price trends over two months, helping you identify the cheapest periods.

## Track Prices

Found a good fare but not ready to book? Use the "Track prices" feature. Google will email you when prices change significantly.

This is useful, but remember: deal alert services like Homebase Flights catch exceptional deals faster and more comprehensively.

## Multi-City Search

Planning a complex itinerary? Use the multi-city search to price out different routing options. Sometimes flying into one city and out of another is cheaper than round-trip.

## Filter by Alliance

Trying to earn miles on a specific program? Filter flights by airline alliance (Star Alliance, Oneworld, SkyTeam) to find options that earn your preferred miles.

## Hidden City Warning

Google Flights will sometimes suggest "hidden city" itineraries where you'd skip the last leg. Be careful with these—airlines can penalize you for not completing your itinerary.

## The Limitations

Google Flights doesn't show:
- Southwest Airlines
- Some budget carriers
- Package deals

For a complete picture, supplement Google Flights searches with direct airline checks.

## Pro Tip: Set Up Alerts

Use Google Flights' price tracking alongside a dedicated deal alert service. Google tracks specific routes you're watching; deal services find exceptional deals you weren't even looking for.

The best savings often come from unexpected opportunities.
