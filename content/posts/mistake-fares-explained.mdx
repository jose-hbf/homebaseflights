faqs:
  - question: "What is a mistake fare?"
    answer: "A mistake fare is a flight price published in error by an airline—usually significantly lower than intended. These can happen due to human error, currency conversion mistakes, or technical glitches."
  - question: "Do airlines honor mistake fares?"
    answer: "Most of the time, yes. Airlines often honor mistake fares to avoid negative publicity. However, they have the legal right to cancel these bookings, so there's always some risk."
  - question: "How long do mistake fares last?"
    answer: "Typically only a few hours. Once an airline notices the error, they correct it quickly. This is why deal alert services that monitor prices 24/7 are so valuable."
  - question: "Should I book travel around a mistake fare?"
    answer: "Wait until the booking is confirmed (usually 24-48 hours) before booking non-refundable hotels or activities. Most mistake fares are honored, but it's wise to be cautious."

Imagine booking a business class flight to Tokyo for $200 instead of $2,000. That's the power of mistake fares.

## What Causes Mistake Fares?

Mistake fares happen for several reasons:

- **Human error** when inputting prices into booking systems
- **Currency conversion mistakes** that result in wrong prices
- **Forgetting to add fuel surcharges** to the base fare
- **Technical glitches** in airline pricing systems
- **Miscommunication** between codeshare partners

These errors are more common than you might think. Airlines manage millions of fares across thousands of routes, and mistakes slip through.

## Do Airlines Honor Them?

Most of the time, yes! Airlines often honor mistake fares rather than deal with the PR nightmare of canceling bookings. However, they do have the legal right to cancel.

The Department of Transportation used to require airlines to honor mistake fares, but that rule changed in 2015. Now it's at the airline's discretion.

That said, most major airlines (especially US carriers) tend to honor these fares. The goodwill is worth more than the lost revenue.

## Famous Mistake Fares

Some legendary mistake fares include:

- **$51 business class to Asia** on British Airways
- **$200 round-trip to Europe** on multiple carriers
- **$400 first class around the world** on various airlines
- **Free flights** when fuel surcharges were accidentally set to negative

These aren't myths—they're real fares that real travelers booked and flew.

## How to Find Them

The key is speed. Mistake fares typically get corrected within hours. That's why deal alert services are invaluable—they monitor fares 24/7 and notify you immediately.

You can't catch a mistake fare if you don't know about it until it's fixed. This is the main advantage of deal alerts over manual searching.

## What to Do When You Find One

1. **Book immediately** - Don't wait. These fares disappear fast.
2. **Don't call the airline** - This can alert them to the error.
3. **Wait 24-48 hours** - Before booking non-refundable hotels.
4. **Have a backup plan** - In case the booking is canceled.

Most mistake fares are honored, but prepare for the small chance they won't be.
