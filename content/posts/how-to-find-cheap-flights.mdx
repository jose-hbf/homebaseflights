Finding cheap flights doesn't have to be complicated. With the right strategies and tools, you can save hundreds—even thousands—on your next trip.

## Be Flexible with Your Dates

The single most effective way to find cheap flights is to be flexible with your travel dates. Prices can vary dramatically from one day to the next.

A Tuesday departure might cost half as much as a Friday flight to the same destination. Use fare calendars and flexible date search tools to find the cheapest options.

## Book at the Right Time

While there's no magic booking window, studies suggest booking domestic flights 1-3 months in advance and international flights 2-8 months ahead typically yields the best prices.

That said, the real secret is to book when you find a good deal. Prices are unpredictable, and waiting for a "better" price often backfires.

## Use Mistake Fares

Airlines occasionally publish fares with errors—sometimes pricing business class at economy rates or forgetting to add fuel surcharges. These "mistake fares" can save you up to 90%.

The key is speed. Mistake fares typically get corrected within hours. That's why deal alert services are invaluable—they monitor fares 24/7 and notify you immediately.

## Consider Alternative Airports

Flying into a nearby airport can sometimes save you hundreds. For example:

- Oakland instead of San Francisco
- Gatwick instead of Heathrow
- Fort Lauderdale instead of Miami
- Newark instead of JFK

Always check nearby airports when searching for flights.

## Sign Up for Deal Alerts

The best deals don't last long. By signing up for flight deal alerts, you'll be notified as soon as a great fare is found from your home airport.

This is the easiest way to save big on flights without spending hours searching. Let the deals come to you.

## Use the Right Search Tools

Google Flights is excellent for exploring options and tracking prices. Skyscanner is great for finding the cheapest month to fly. Momondo sometimes surfaces deals others miss.

But remember: search tools show you what's available now. Deal alert services find the exceptional prices before they disappear.

## Be Ready to Book

When you find a great deal, don't hesitate. Cheap fares disappear quickly, sometimes within hours. Have your passport ready and be prepared to book immediately.

The travelers who save the most are the ones who are ready to act when opportunity strikes.
